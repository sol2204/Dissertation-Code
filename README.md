# Dissertation-Code  

Python code for my undergraduate dissertation analyzing how **Chinese state media portrayed Japan in English (2013‚Äì2025)**.  

The project uses **LDA topic modeling** to identify themes, track their evolution, and explore how these connect to concepts of **strategic narratives**.

## üìÇ Project Structure  

The repository contains three Python scripts that form a complete pipeline:  

1. **URL Scraper**  
   - Scrapes URLs from the *People‚Äôs Daily* English-language website.  
   - Saves the results into a CSV file.  

2. **Article Scraper**  
   - Visits each URL from step 1.  
   - Extracts article text content.  
   - Saves the cleaned text and metadata (e.g., date, title) into a new CSV.  

3. **LDA Model**  
   - Reads in the dataset of articles.  
   - Preprocesses and tokenizes the text.  
   - Runs **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** topic modeling.  
   - Identifies latent ‚Äútopics‚Äù in the corpus, computes **coherence scores**, and prints top representative articles for each topic.
